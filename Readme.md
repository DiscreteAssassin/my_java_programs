# Java DSA Examples

This project contains example implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics in Java. Each topic is covered with simple, well-commented code to help learners understand the fundamentals and usage in real-world scenarios.

## Topics Covered

- **Linked Lists**  
  Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Stack**  
  Stack data structure using arrays and linked lists, including push, pop, and peek operations.

- **Recursion**  
  Examples demonstrating recursive algorithms such as factorial, Fibonacci, and tree traversals.

- **Tree**  
  Binary tree and binary search tree (BST) implementations, with traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).

- **Graph**  
  Graph representations using adjacency lists and matrices, with traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).

- **Hash Table**  
  Simple hash table implementation with collision handling techniques.

- **Sorting**  
  Common sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

- **Serialization**  
  Techniques for serializing and deserializing data structures in Java.

- **ENUMS**  
  Usage of Java enums for type-safe constants and switch-case examples.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the desired example file using the terminal:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
4. Explore other folders for different DSA topics.

## Example

The `1-MyLinkedList` folder demonstrates basic linked list operations:

```java
MyList m = new MyList();
m.addLast(10);
m.addFirst(20);
m.removeAfter(20);
m.traversal();
```
